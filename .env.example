# IMPORTANT: Twitter API v2 Free Tier Information
# 1. Essential (Free) access has limited search capabilities
# 2. You can search for basic keywords but advanced features require paid plans
# 3. Rate limits: 300 requests per 15-minute window
# 4. Some endpoints may return 403 errors on free tier - this is normal

# Twitter API Access Levels:
# - Essential (Free): Basic search, limited features
# - Basic ($100/month): Full search access, higher limits
# - Pro ($5000/month): Advanced features, highest limits

# Troubleshooting 403 Errors:
# - 403 errors are NORMAL for free Twitter API accounts
# - The app automatically falls back to demo content
# - Consider upgrading to Basic plan for full search access
# - Verify your developer account is approved
# - Check if you need elevated access for search endpoints
# - Ensure your Bearer Token has the correct permissions

# Free Version Limitations:
# - Limited search queries per month
# - Reduced rate limits
# - Some advanced search features unavailable
# - This is expected behavior for Essential access
